# Tech Spec Generation Workflow
#
# Triggered when a PR is merged to develop with changes to product specs.
# Creates a GitHub issue and assigns it to Copilot with the Architect agent
# to convert product specs into technical specifications.
#
# Required Secrets:
#   COPILOT_PAT - Personal Access Token with the following permissions:
#     - repo (full control of private repositories)
#     - issues:write (to create and update issues)
#   This token is required because the default GITHUB_TOKEN cannot assign
#   issues to the Copilot agent due to GitHub's licensing restrictions.
